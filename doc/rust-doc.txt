INTRODUCTION                                         *rust-doc.vim-introduction*

*rust-doc.vim* searches documents (standard libraries, libraries your crate
depends on, and so on) and opens it by browser.  You can use 3 interfaces to
open them.

- |:RustDoc| command for detailed search
- |K| mapping in your Rust code to search under the cursor
- |unite.vim| source to list up all candidates and select one


==============================================================================
INSTALL                                                   *rust-doc.vim-install*

If you use some plugin manager, please follow the instruction of them.
For example, you can install this plugin with |neobundle.vim| as below.
>
    NeoBundle 'rhysd/rust-doc.vim'
<
Otherwise, copy all directories and files in "autoload", "plugin" and "doc"
directories to your "~/.vim" directory's corresponding directories.

If you want to see standard library documents, you must set
|g:rust_doc#downloaded_rust_doc_dir|.  The variable should be string type and
contain the path to rust documents directory bundled in downloaded rust tar.

e.g.

    1. Download documents and set it to your document directory
>
    $ wget https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-1.0.0-i686-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
    $ tar xf rust-1.0.0-i686-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
    $ mv rust-1.0.0-i686-unknown-linux-gnu/rust-doc ~/Documents/
<
    2. Set |g:rust_doc#downloaded_rust_doc_dir|
>
    let g:rust_doc#downloaded_rust_doc_dir = '~/Documents/rust-docs'
<

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                       *rust-doc.vim-usage*

As described above, 3 interfaces are available.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. |:RustDoc| command

    *:RustDoc* {crate-or-module} [{identifier}]            *rust-doc.vim-:RustDoc*

        You can search the documents with crate name or module
        name with identifier.  Identifier is a name of constant, trait, struct
        and so on.

        For example, assume your crate uses "rand" crate.

>
        (1) :RustDoc rand
        (2) :RustDoc rand::distributions
        (3) :RustDoc rand Rng
<

        (1) opens the document for crate rand.
        (2) opens the document for module rand::distributions.
        (3) opens the document for trait rand::Rng.

        Of course standard libraries documents are also available.
>
        :RustDoc std::vec
<

    *:RustDocFuzzy* {identifier}                      *rust-doc.vim-:RustDocFuzzy*

        |rust-doc.vim| searches the documents with {identifier} fuzzily.
        It lists up all possibilities and you can select one of them.  If only
        one candidate exists, |rust-doc.vim| opens it instantly.

        e.g.
>
        :RustDocFuzzy distributions
<

    *:RustDocModule* {name}                          *rust-doc.vim-:RustDocModule*

        It searches the name of modules with {name}.
        If only one candidate is found, |rust-doc.vim| opens the document
        instantly.  Otherwise, it lists up all candidates and you can select
        on of them.

        e.g.
>
        :RustDocModule std::io
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. |K| mapping in your Rust code                          *rust-doc.vim-K-mapping*


    |rust-doc.vim| automatically overwrites default |K| mapping only in Rust
    code.  The K mapping opens most corresponding document.  It is available
    in normal mode and visual mode.  In normal mode, the word under the cursor
    is used.  In visual mode, the selected text is used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. |unite.vim| source                                  *rust-doc.vim-unite-source*

    You can select from all document candidates with unite.vim interface.
>
    :Unite rust/doc
<
    It may takes some time.  If you don't want to wait and it is enough for
    you to search only module names, please specify "modules" to the argument
    of "rust/doc" source as below.
>
    :Unite rust/doc:modules
<

==============================================================================
VARIABLES                                               *rust-doc.vim-variables*

g:rust_doc#vim_open_cmd                                *g:rust_doc#vim_open_cmd*

Vim command to open the path to a document.  |rust-doc.vim| uses it to open the
document if it is not empty.  The command must take a URL to the local file.


g:rust_doc#open_cmd                                        *g:rust_doc#open_cmd*

Shell command to open the path to a document.  |rust-doc.vim| uses it to open
the document if it is not empty.  The command must take a URL to the local
file.


g:rust_doc#do_not_ask_for_module_list
                                         *g:rust_doc#do_not_ask_for_module_list*

If the value is 1, |rust-doc.vim|| never ask if it shows the list of
modules/identifiers when no document is found.
The default value is 0.


g:rust_doc#define_map_K                                *g:rust_doc#define_map_K*

If the value is 1, |K| mappings described above is defined.
The default value is 1.


g:rust_doc#downloaded_rust_doc_dir          *g:rust_doc#downloaded_rust_doc_dir*

Rust tar package contains documents directory "rust-doc".  If you want to
search the documents in it, you must set the path to the directory to this
variable.  If the value is not empty, |rust-doc.vim| searches the documents in
it.  The default value is "".
